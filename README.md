# Weather-App
A simple and interactive weather application built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
The app allows users to search for a city and fetch real-time weather information using the Visual Crossing Weather API.
It includes proper error handling, asynchronous API calls using async/await, dynamic UI updates, and temperature unit toggling logic.
This project focuses on strengthening core JavaScript concepts such as promises, event handling, and DOM manipulation without using any frameworks.
